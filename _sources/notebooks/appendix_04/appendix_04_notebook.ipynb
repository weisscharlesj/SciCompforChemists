    "There is a saying that synthetic chemists spend 10% of their time running reactions and 90% of their time purifying compounds. A similar saying could be said that working with chemical data is 10% performing the intended calculations or analyses on the data and 90% of the time cleaning and organizing the data. While these are both hyperbole, they underline the large amount of effort required to clean materials. This chapter is dedicated to a powerful methods known as **regular expressions**, or **regex** for short, for cleaning and filtering text data, especially in situations requiring complex pattern matching. Python [string methods](1.3.3) and [indexing](1.3.2) offer basic search and filtering functionality, but they tend to only allow for identifying simple and consistent patterns. For example, if you want a file name without the file extension (e.g., *titration* instead of *titration.png*), this can be solved using indexing and the string `split()` method because file extensions always follow the last period in the full file name. Likewise, parsing data from a [PDB file](16.2.1) can be parsed with only a string search and slicing because PDB files follow very strict formatting rules based on labels and positions in rows. The reason these two examples are not terribly complex to parse is because they are consistent and were designed to be machine readable. However, not all data follow well-defined formatting rules or there could be more variation that needs to be accounted for. Regular expressions is not strictly a Python feature but rather is a syntax supported by Python using the `re` module imported below. This module is a built-in Python module, so it comes with every installation of Python."

For example, it is not uncommon to see numbers separated by either a period *or* dash (e.g., phone numbers), so `[-.]` can be used to indicate that either symbol is a fit. Regular expressions also allows for ranges of letters and numbers such as `[a-e]` for any of the first five lowercase letters. It is a good idea to place the dash first to ensure that it does not get interpreted as a range.\n",

Both symbols can be enclosed in the square brackets like `[4p]`. The next challenge is figuring out how to deal with the rest of the symbols. We could try `.+` to indicated any number of more symbols, but this includes white spaces and returns the rest of the string."

    "Let's now do some extra examples. When downloading data files from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the CAS number is mixed in with other names and numerical identifiers. There are two challenges here. The first is that CAS numbers vary in length. They are always three segments of numbers separated by hyphens, such as 58-08-2 or 2501-94-2, where the second segment is always two digits and the thirds is always a single digit. However the first segment varies from 2-7 digits. The second major issue is that the CAS numbers are mixed in with other chemical identifiers such as CID numbers, common names, and IUPAC names. These other identifiers can include hyphens and numbers, so indexing and string searches cannot easily filter for CAS numbers without a long series of boolean conditions. \n",

    "It looks like the code finds all the signals. One more addition that would be helpful in making the code more robust is to add the possibility of a negative chemical shift. While proton chemical shift are typically positive, negative values do show up in situations such as silanes with Si-H bonds or metal hydrides. To allow for this possibility, a `-?` is placed in the front indicated that the negative may or may not be there. To test this, an extra negative resonance was added just for testing purposes."
