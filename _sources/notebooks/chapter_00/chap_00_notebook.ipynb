    "Python is a popular programming language available on all major computer platforms, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.  It is a scripting language, which means that the moment the user presses the Return key or Run, the Python software interprets and runs the code. This is in contrast to a compiled language like C, where the code must first be translated into binary (i.e., machine language) before it can be run. On-the-fly interpretation makes Python quick to use and often provides the user with rapid results. This is ideal for scientific data analysis, where the user is routinely making changes to the processing and visualization of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free, open-source software and is maintained by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). This is appealing for two major reasons. The first is that it is widely, freely, and irrevocably available to anyone who wants to use it, regardless of budget. With proprietary software, which is more and more commonly offered under a subscription model, if a company stops offering or updating a software package, it may simply become unavailable, leaving users without the software they built their work around. Second, it is open source, so anyone can inspect and modify the code. This allows anyone to review the code to ensure it does what it claims instead of relying on the assertions of the software distributor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to use Python over other options, free or otherwise, is the power and the community support available to Python users. Python is a common and popular programming language that has been applied to a wide variety of applications, including data analysis, visualization, machine learning, robotics, web scraping, 3D graphics, and more. As a result, there is a large community built around Python that provides valuable support for those who need assistance. If you are stuck on a problem or have a question, a quick internet search will likely provide the answer. Common internet forums include stackexchange.com or stackoverflow.com among others. If you have a question or need help on something, you are probably not the first person to ask that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with Python, this book uses the IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks as a medium for running and sharing Python code. More details are given below on Jupyter notebooks, but for now, know that they provide interactive environments ideal for scientific computing. In addition, we will use a variety of free, open-source libraries to provide collections of useful functions for scientific data processing, analysis, and visualization. Think of a library as an add-on or tool pack for Python, and there are many to choose from."

We will cover two common options below - this includes either installing the software on your own computer using Anaconda or using Google Colab to run the software from a Google server. Both are relatively simple to set up and have different advantages. Some of the major advantages of each are listed below. \n",

Two common options are the Anaconda Distribution and the Miniconda [installers](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success), both provided for free by Anaconda Inc. There are other installation options available, but the instructions in this book often assume one of these options. Miniconda is currently recommended over the Anaconda Distribution installer even though Miniconda requires a little more effort. When installing the software, be sure to choose **Python 3** as this is the current version. While some applications still support Python 2, it is technically legacy. As of the time of this writing, multiple major projects in the scientific Python ecosystem no longer support Python 2, so it is likely in your interest to be on Python 3. You are strongly encouraged to install the most recent version of Python.\n",

    "The [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) brings almost everything you need. Any software used in this book that is not installed by default with Anaconda is addressed in its respective chapter. If you want to install additional libraries, open the Anaconda-Navigator (green circle icon) and select the **Environment** tab on the left. Select **Not Installed** from the pull-down menu to see all the libraries available to be installed as shown in Figure 1. To install a library, check the box next to it and click the **Apply** button that appears on the bottom right. Anaconda will install it and anything else that is required for the new library to work properly. To update a library, select **Upgradable** from the pull-down menu, select the package(s) you want to update, and click **Apply**. \n",

    "3. Install core Python packages using either pip or conda. Below is a list of packages that should be installed to get started. It is strongly recommended to stick with either pip or conda and avoid using a mixture of both because this can lead to issues later on.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Conda Environments (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of environments is technically an optional one. If you are just getting started, you can probably skip over this for now, but as you establish yourself more in coding and work on more projects, it is a good idea to learn to use environments. Using environments is considered best practice and allows you to have multiple different versions of Python and/or Python packages installed on a single computer at the same time. This is helpful when you are working on multiple projects with different software requirements. There are two common types of environments you will often hear about - conda and venv. We address using conda environments here. Again, if you are just getting started, this may not be necessary, but here are instructions for doing this when the time comes. \n",

    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Terminal on your computer or in JupyterLab and type **one** of the following commands to create a new conda environment with the name <env_name>. The <env_name> can be anything you want. The `python` tells the command to also install Python in that environment. Optionally, you can also list Python packages to install in the environment at this stage by listing them as is done in the second command example.\n",

    "\n",
    "        conda env list\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Next, we need to switch over to the new environment by typing the `activate` command below. If you again type `conda env list`, you will see the `*` has shifted from `base` to your new environment indicating that your new environment is currently active.\n",
    "\n",
    "        conda activate <env_name>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If you want to install additional libraries in this environment, you can do this now using `conda` or `pip`. Remember to install JupyterLab if you intend to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If you want to use this environment in a Jupyter notebook, you will need to register it with JupyterLab. First install ipykernel (e.g., `conda install ipykernel` or `pip install ipykernel`) and then type the command below to register your environment with JupyterLab. Now when you start a new Jupyter notebook, your new environment will be an option. There will also be a pull-down menu on the top right of your notebook where you can select which environment you want to use.\n",

    "\n",
    "To remove an old environment you don't need anymore, do the following.\n",
    "1. Deactivate the old environment by switching to some other environment like `base`. This can be done using either the `deactivate` command or explicitly switching to the base environment with the `activate` command.\n",

    "   or\n",

    "One difference between writing code in a code cell versus a Markdown cell is that code cells color the text based on the syntax or the role the text plays in the code, known as *syntax highlighting*, and Markdown cells do not. It would be like if a word processor colored nouns gray, verbs orange, prepositions blue, and punctuation marks red so that the reader can see the role each word or symbol plays in a sentence. If you want to include example text in a Markdown cell with syntax highlighting, place `~~~python` in the line above the code and `~~~` in the line below the code."

    "Along with Markdown cells, it is good practice to add comments to your code. Comments are a means of describing what each section of code does and make it easier for you and others to navigate the code. It may seem clear to you what each piece of code does as you write it, but after a week, month, or longer, it is unlikely to be as obvious. Someone (attribution uncertain) once elegantly described the importance of comments in stating that \"Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don’t reply to emails.\" Comment your code now so that you are not confused later.\n",
