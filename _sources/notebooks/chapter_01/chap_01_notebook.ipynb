Doing math in a Python interpreter is similar to using a graphing calculator – the user inputs a mathematical expression in a line and presses **Return** (or **Shift-Return** in the case of a Jupyter notebook cell), and the output appears directly below.

The `for` loop successively checks to see if there is more or equal moles of HCl as NaOH (i.e., the equivalence point). If not, the volume of HCl is incremented by one milliliter. "

    "Up to this point, we have only been dealing with computer-generated and manually typed values, strings, lists, and tuples. In research and laboratory environments, we often need to work with data stored in a file. These files may be generated from an instrument or as the result of humans typing values into a spreadsheet as they take measurements or make observations. There are two general categories of data files: text and binary files. *Text files* are those that, when opened by a text editor, can be read by humans, while *binary files* cannot. The reading of binary files requires other specialized software, such as demonstrated in [chapter 11](11), and text files are very common for storing data, so we will focus only on text files here. \n",

Common examples include comma separated values (CSV), protein database (PDB), and *xyz* coordinates (XYZ). These files have different extensions (i.e., those 3-4 letters after the period at the end of a file name), but they are all just text files. You can change the extension to *.txt* if you like and open them in any text editor or word processor. The *.csv*, *.pdb*, and *.xyz* are simply tags to help your computer decide which software application can and should open the file.\n",

Comma separated value files are a way of encoding information that might otherwise be stored in a spreadsheet, and spreadsheet applications are able to easily read and write CSV files.  Each line of the text file is a different row, and each item in a row is separated by commas... hence the name. Below are the contents of a CSV file and how it would look in a spreadsheet. In some files, you may see a `\\n` at the end of each line. This is a line terminator character telling some software applications where a line ends.\n",
