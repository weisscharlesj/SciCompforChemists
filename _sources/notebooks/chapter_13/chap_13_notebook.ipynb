    "Up to this point, we have been running all of our Python scripts through the IPython environment from either a Jupyter notebook or a Python interpreter. A third way to run Python code is to save it as text files and run the code from the computer's or Jupyter's terminal. The advantage of this approach is that it is more practical for larger scripts and more convenient for doing repetitive tasks like reformatting instrument data. You will need access to the terminal to run your Python script which is discussed below.\n"

    "\n",
    "The terminal is the command line interface used in macOS and unix-like systems such as the Linux and BSD families and allows users to perform a wide array of tasks from installing and running software to file management. If you are using Linux or Mac, launch the terminal from the applications, and if you are on Windows, you will likely first need to activate the Bash command line before proceeding. Alternatively, if you are using the JupyterLab version of Jupyer, you can launch a terminal window from the Launcher menu (see [section 0.2](0.2), Figure 2). In section 13.2, you will learn to run Python scripts from the terminal, but before you can run a script, you need to be able to navigate your file system and find your Python scripts. This section is a brief primer on navigating the file system through the Terminal."

The argument inside the `input()` function is what is displayed in front of the user to prompt an input. It is important to note that the `input()` function provides the user input as a string.

To get some of these features back, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

To run the code written here, you can either save it as a text file and run it as described above, or you can press the run button (►) at the top of the window. The latter approach is particularly handy during the development phase of a script as it allows you to quickly test and modify your script without having to jump between Spyder and the terminal. The smaller window on the bottom right is a Python terminal where you can test out code and see the output of your code if you run your code inside Spyder. The top right window is useful as a file navigator and as a variable explorer depending upon the tabs you choose. In Figure 2, it is a variable explorer which shows each variable in memory and what it contains.

The decision is often a matter of preference, but if you are doing interactive data analysis, Jupyter notebooks are typically the better choice.

As an example, if you wish to perform complex mining of information from an external data set and then analyze the resulting information, you might want to write the data mining code in Spyder and then run the data analysis in a Jupyter notebook."
