These are also known as *associative arrays*. Dictionaries allow the user to access the stored values using a key without knowing anything about the order of items in the dictionary. One way to think of a dictionary is as an object full of variables and assigned values. For example, if we are looking to write a script to calculate the molecular weight of a compound based on its molecular formula, we would need access to the atomic mass of each element based on the elemental symbol. Here the key is the symbol and the value is the atomic mass. It looks something like a list with curly brackets and each item is a `key:value` pair separated by a colon.

Up to this point, we have been opening files that are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook, so Jupyter has no difficulty finding the files. However, if you ever want to open a file somewhere else on your computer or open multiple files, this module is particularly useful. Below you will learn to use the os module to open files in non-local directories (i.e., not the directory your Jupyter notebook is in) and to open an entire folder of files.\n",

It takes a single string argument of the path in string format to the folder containing the files of interest. For example, if the files are in a folder called “my_folder” on your computer desktop, you might use something like the following. The exact format will vary depending on your computer and if you are using macOS, Windows, or Linux.\n",

Imagine you have not just a single CSV file with data but an entire folder of similar CSV files that you need to import into Python.

However, there are instances where you will need to understand a little about how numbers are encoded such as in grayscale images (chapter 7). \n",

Once we get to 9, the digit returns to 0 and a 1 is placed to the left. In a binary numbering system, we use only 0 and 1 to describe values.

    "Probably the simplest way to encode a number is an unsigned 8-bit integer. The “unsigned” means that it cannot have a negative sign while the “8-bit” means it can use eight zeros and ones to describe the number. For example, if we want to encode the number 3, it is 00000011. Even if not all the bits are strictly required, they have been allotted for the storage of this value, and with 8 bits, we can encode numbers from 0 $\\rightarrow$ 255 (i.e., 00000000 $\\rightarrow$ 11111111).

    "To encode negative integers, signed integers are required. The key difference between a signed and unsigned integer is that an unsigned integer is always positive while a signed integer can describe positive and negative values by using the first bit to describe the sign. The first bit is 0 for a positive number and 1 for a negative number. Because the first bit is reserved for sign, a signed integer can describe values of only half the magnitude as an unsigned integer of the same bit length. For example, an 8-bit signed integer can describe values from -128 $\\rightarrow$ 127. All combinations of zeros/ones that start with a 0 define positive values from 0 $\\rightarrow$ 127 while all combinations of zeros/ones that start with a 1 define values from -128 $\\rightarrow$ -1. That is, 10000000 equals -128 while 11111111 describes -1.\n",
