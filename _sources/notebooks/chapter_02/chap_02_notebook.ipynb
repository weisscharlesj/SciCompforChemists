Up to this point, we have been opening files that are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook, so Jupyter has no difficulty finding the files. However, if you ever want to open a file somewhere else on your computer or open multiple files, this module is particularly useful. Below you will learn to use the os module to open files in non-local directories (i.e., not the directory your Jupyter notebook is in) and to open an entire folder of files.\n",

It takes a single string argument of the path in string format to the folder containing the files of interest. For example, if the files are in a folder called “my_folder” on your computer desktop, you might use something like the following. The exact format will vary depending upon your computer and if you are using macOS, Windows, or Linux.\n",

For example, if we want to encode the number 3, it is 00000011. Even if not all the bits are strictly required, they have been allotted for the storage of this value, and with 8 bits, we can encode numbers from 0 $\\rightarrow$ 255 (i.e., 00000000 $\\rightarrow$ 11111111).

The key difference between a signed and unsigned integer is that unsigned are always positive while signed can describe positive and negative values by using the first bit to describe the sign. The first bit is 0 for a positive and 1 for a negative number. Because the first bit is reserved for sign, a signed integer can describe values of only half the magnitude as an unsigned integer of the same bit length. For example, an 8-bit signed integer can describe values from -128 $\\rightarrow$ 127. All combinations of zeros/ones that start with a 0 define positive values from 0 $\\rightarrow$ 127 while all combinations of zeros/ones that start with a 1 define values from -128 $\\rightarrow$ -1. That is, 10000000 equals -128 while 11111111 describes -1.\n",

At least when code fails to run, the user knows something is wrong whereas code that fails silently can lull the user into false conclusions. It is a prudent pratice in coding to include checks that important conditions are met, and when these conditions are not met, the code should stop and produce an error known as *raising an exception*.  To include checks in your code, you can use a condition with a `raise` statement followed by some form of error from Table 7 and an error message.

For example, `AATGC` and `AATGT` have a Hamming distance of 1 because they are identical except for the last base position. Because it is critical that the two DNA sequences be the same length, this should be checked before any furthur calculations, and if the sequences have different lengths, the function should not proceed and provide a helpful error message.
