# Scientific Computing for Chemists with Python

### An Introduction to Programming in Python with Chemical Applications


The following is the textbook used for the Scientific Computing Chemists course intended to teach chemists and chemistry students basic computer programming in Python and Jupyter Notebooks and advanced tools for processing, visualization, and analysis of digital data. 

## [Read Scientific Computing for Chemists with Python (Jupyter Book)](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/)

A chapter outline is provided below. The book starts with a streamlined introduction to Python for chemists followed by introducing powerful computing tools and numerous applications to chemistry. This book assumes that the student or reader has no prior programming experience and has at least one year of undergraduate chemistry background and some very basic spectroscopy/spectrometry (i.e., NMR, IR, UV-vis, and GC/MS) background. All software used (e.g., Python, NumPy, SciPy, etc...) is free and open source software and runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This book is periodically updated to fix typos, account for new software versions, and add new content. The most recent version can be viewed using the link above or downloaded or forked above along with Jupyter notebooks containing all code in the book. Reports of errors and information on how people are using this book are always welcome.

## Interested in Using This Book for Your Course?

First, I'd love to hear how people are using this book. Second, this book may receive updates with additional content, clarifications, and corrections, so if you want a static copy of the book to use during the academic term, below are multiple options.

1. (Simpler) Download PDF copies of the chapters to share with your student - at the top right of each chapter page, click the download button and select the PDF option.

2. Fork this repository to your GitHub page and have your students use your copy - create a GitHub account, fork this repository, build the book using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/), and have you students use your copy on your GitHub page. You can update your fork of this repository at any time to received any updates, and unlike a PDF copy, this approach makes it easier for students to copy-and-paste code from the chapters. The approach does require the user be confortable using git and GitHub.
