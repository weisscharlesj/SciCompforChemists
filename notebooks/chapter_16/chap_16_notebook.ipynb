    "# Chapter 16: Bioinformations with Biopython\n",
    "\n",
    "Bioinformatics is the field of working with biological or biochemical data using computing resources, and while the data is fundamentally no different than the data seen so far, this field is large and significant enough to warrant its own chapter. More importantly, bioinformatics contains a multitude of different file formats making this a significant hurdle in working with these data. The good news is that these file formats are usually text files like seen in the previous chapters, and there are Python libraries available to facilitate the parsing and working with these file formats and data. This chapter will start by looking at a few common file formats, parsing them with our own code followed by introducing the biopython library to perform the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will be utilizing the biopython library which  which is among the well-known libraries for working with biological and biochemical data. It will need to be installed in Anaconda and Google Colab as it is not a standard library. As of this writing, it can be installed [using pip](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) by `pip install biopython`. Once installed, it is imported as `Bio`. This chapter assums the following imports."

However, the number of A/T pairs does not neccesarily equal the number of G/C pairs. The ratio of G/C to A/T can have an effect on the stability of a DNA structure among other things.

    "### 16.2.1 Reading PDB Files with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDB file format is a classic file format for holding protein sequence and structual information including the information listed below. While the PDB is being slowly replaced by the mmCIF discussed below, the PDB file format is still quite common and worth looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amino acid sequence\n",
    "- Number of strands\n",
    "- Location and identity of non-amino acid species\n",
    "- *xyz* coordinates of atoms in the crystal structure including trapped solvents\n",
    "- Metadata about the protein (e.g., date collected, resolutin, etc...)\n",
    "- Secondary structure information \n",
    "\n",
    "PDB files are text files with the data arranged with specific line labels and infromation within a line is identified based on *position* in a line. This is in constrast to many other file types where data in a single line is distinguished by seperators such as commas or spaces. For more information on PDB file formats, see the [Protein Data Bank website](https://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need a PDB file a protein structure which can be downloaded for free from the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/).  Select any protein that you find interesting and download the PDB file by clicking the **Download Files** menu on the top right and selecting **PDF Format**. While you're at it, also download the mmCIF (***PDBx/mmCIF Format**) and fasta (**FASTA Sequence**) files for your protein structure becasue we will look at those next. In the example below, we will look at Vanadium nitrogenase VFe protein in the **7aiz.pdf** file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter Lab, you can double click the PDB file to view the contents. The file is organized where each line holds a different type of information, and the far left of each line includes a label in all caps indicating what type of information is stored in each line. Below are some key labels (i.e., record type), but this is far from a comprehensive list.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Record Type | Description          |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|Header       | Name of protein and date |\n",
    "|TITLE        | Name of protein          |\n",
    "|COMPND       | Information about the compound |\n",
    "|SOURCE       | Information about the source of the protein (e.g., source organism) |\n",
    "|SEQRES       | Amino acid sequence and which strand each belongs         |\n",
    "|HET, HETNAM       | Information about non-amino acids in protein structure    |\n",
    "|HELIX        | Information about helicies including type, start and end amino acids, etc...|\n",
    "|SHEET        | Information about sheets including start and end amino acids and sense |\n",
    "|ATOM         | Information about indificiaul atoms in structure inclidng *xyz* coordinates, identity, amino acid, etc...|\n",

    "As an exercise, we can extract information about the $\\beta$-sheets in the protein. Specifically, we will look at the sense which is whether two strands run in the same direction (parallel) or in the opposite direction (antiparallel). This is indicated by the an integer in positions 39-40 of a SHEET line and can be either `0` for the first strand of a $\\beta$-sheet, `1` for a strand parallel with the previous strand, and `-1` for a strand antiparallel with the previous strand. The function below extract this information by opening the PDB `file`, moving through each line of the file, and if the line begins with `SHEET`, it appends the sense to a list and returns the populated list."

    "Next, we will use the biopython library to read data from PDB files. One of the appeals of using biopython is that the user does not need to understand the strucutre of the PDB file format; biopython handles extracting the desired information from the data file in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import the `PDB` of the biopython library with the `import Bio.PDB` command (see [start of this chapter](16)) if you have not done so already. Biopython, like SciPy, requires that indivifual modules be imported one at a time instead of the entire library (i.e., you can't just type `import Bio`). If you prefer to import a function individually or module into the global namesapce to shorten your function calls (i.e., `from Bio.PDB import *` or `from Bio.PDB import PDBParser()`), you are welcome to do this, but herein we will use `import Bio.PDB` so that the code more clearly shows the source of every function. This module provides tools for dealing with the 3D structural data of macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA. Despite the name, the `PDB` module has tools for also dealing with the mmCIF, PQR, and MMTF file formats. "

We will also want to attach our parser object to a variable."

Next, use the `set_structure()` method on the writing object to load the data from an individual structure. Finally, write the file using the `save()` function and providing it with the name of the new file as a string."

    "You may notice that the first and last dihedral angles were slices off the list of phi and psi angles (last two lines of code). This is becuase there are no phi ($\\phi$) values for first amino acid and no psi ($\\psi$) values in the last amino acid. Dihedral angle measurements require four atoms, and those terminal amino acids are missing one of the required four atoms. For example, phi ($\\phi$) dihedral angles are measured from the N-C$_\\alpha$ bond of a C(O)-N-C$_\\alpha$-C(O) chain of atoms, but the first amine acids only have N-C$_\\alpha$-C(O)."
