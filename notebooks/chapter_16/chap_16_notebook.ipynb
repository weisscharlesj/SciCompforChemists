    "# Chapter 16: Bioinformations with Biopython\n",
    "\n",
    "Bioinformatics is the field of working with biological or biochemical data using computing resources, and while the data is fundamentally no different than the data seen so far, this field is large and significant enough to warrant its own chapter. More importantly, bioinformatics contains a multitude of different file formats making this a significant hurdle in working with these data. The good news is that these file formats are usually text files like seen in the previous chapters, and there are Python libraries available to facilitate the parsing and working with these file formats and data. This chapter will start by looking at a few common file formats, parsing them with our own code followed by introducing the biopython library to perform the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will be utilizing the biopython library which  which is among the well-known libraries for working with biological and biochemical data. It will need to be installed in Anaconda and Google Colab as it is not a standard library. As of this writing, it can be installed [using pip](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) by `pip install biopython`. Once installed, it is imported as `Bio`. This chapter assums the following imports."

However, the number of A/T pairs does not neccesarily equal the number of G/C pairs. The ratio of G/C to A/T can have an effect on the stability of a DNA structure among other things.

    "As an exercise, we can extract information about the $\\beta$-sheets in the protein. Specifically, we will look at the sense which is whether two strands run in the same direction (parallel) or in the opposite direction (antiparallel). This is indicated by the an integer in positions 39-40 of a SHEET line and can be either `0` for the first strand of a $\\beta$-sheet, `1` for a strand parallel with the previous strand, and `-1` for a strand antiparallel with the previous strand. The function below extract this information by opening the PDB `file`, moving through each line of the file, and if the line begins with `SHEET`, it appends the sense to a list and returns the populated list."

    "Next, we will use the biopython library to read data from PDB files. One of the appeals of using biopython is that the user does not need to understand the strucutre of the PDB file format; biopython handles extracting the desired information from the data file in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import the `PDB` of the biopython library with the `import Bio.PDB` command (see [start of this chapter](16)) if you have not done so already. Biopython, like SciPy, requires that indivifual modules be imported one at a time instead of the entire library (i.e., you can't just type `import Bio`). If you prefer to import a function individually or module into the global namesapce to shorten your function calls (i.e., `from Bio.PDB import *` or `from Bio.PDB import PDBParser()`), you are welcome to do this, but herein we will use `import Bio.PDB` so that the code more clearly shows the source of every function. This module provides tools for dealing with the 3D structural data of macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA. Despite the name, the `PDB` module has tools for also dealing with the mmCIF, PQR, and MMTF file formats. "

We will also want to attach our parser object to a variable."

Dihedral angle measurements require four atoms, and those terminal amino acids are missing one of the required four atoms. For example, phi ($\\phi$) dihedral angles are measured from the N-C$_\\alpha$ bond of a C(O)-N-C$_\\alpha$-C(O) chain of atoms, but the first amine acids only have N-C$_\\alpha$-C(O)."
