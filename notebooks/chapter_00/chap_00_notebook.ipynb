    "Python is a popular programming language available on all major computer platforms including Mac, Linux, and Windows.  It is a scripting language which means that the moment the user presses the Return key or Run, the Python software interprets and runs the code. This is in contrast to a compiled language like C where the code must first be translated into binary (i.e., machine language) before it can be run. On-the-fly interpretation makes Python quick to use and often provides the user with rapid results. This is ideal for scientific data analysis where the user is routinely making changes to the processing and visualization of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free, open source software and is maintained by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). This is appealing for two major reasons. The first is that it is widely, freely, and irrevocably available to anyone who wants to use it regardless of budget. With proprietary software, which is more and more commonly offered under a subscription model, if a company stops offering or updating a software package, it may simply become unavailable leaving users without the software they built their work around. Second, it is open source, so anyone can inspect and modify the code. This allows anyone to review the code to ensure it does what it claims instead of relying on the assertions of the software distributer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to use Python over other options, free or otherwise, is the power and the community support available to Python users. Python is a common and popular programming language that has been applied to a wide variety of applications including data analysis, visualization, machine learning, robotics, web scraping, 3D graphics, and more. As a result, there is a large community built around Python that provides valuable support for those who need assistance. If you are stuck on a problem or have a question, a quick internet search will likely provide the answer. Common internet forums include stackexchange.com or stackoverflow.com among others. If you have a question or need help on something, you are probably not the first person to ask that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with Python, this book uses the IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks as a medium for running and sharing Python code. More details are give below on Jupyter notebooks, but for now, know that they provide interactive environments ideal for scientific computing. In addition, we will use a variety of free, open source libraries to provide collections of useful functions for scientific data processing, analysis, and visualization. Think of a library as an add-on or tool pack for Python, and there are many to choose from."

    "The first step is to install the software, if you have not done so already, and there are multiple options for software installation. The first is to install Python followed by Jupyter, IPython, and all of the libraries. This is a tedious process. The faster and more convenient approach is to use an installer that brings nearly all the software with it. The Anaconda installer (link below) provided for free by Continuum Analytics is a very popular option that does exactly this. There are other installation options available, but the instructions in this book for launching applications assumes Anaconda. When installing the software, be sure to choose **Python 3** as this is the current version. While many applications still support Python 2, it is technically legacy with support being gradually removed. As of the time of this writing, multiple major projects in the scientific Python ecosystem have announced that current or future releases of their software will no longer support Python 2, so it is likely in your interest to be on Python 3. Most of the examples in this book will probably work in Python 2 if you absolutely must use it, but you are *strongly* encouraged to install the most recent version of Python.\n",
